### Resource Pack Shuffler (Work in progress)
 *This is a Python script that shuffles Minecraft resource packs, creating cursed resource/texture packs.*

# How to download and run
**1. You need to install the latest version of Python (3.8 or higher) to run the shuffler.**

Get Python at: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**2. When setting up Python, make sure to check "Add Python x.x to PATH"**

See this image for more information: https://datatofish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0001_add_Python_to_Path.png

**3. Download this project**

Click the green 'Clone or download' button, then click 'Download ZIP'

**4. Extract the 'shuffler.py' script anywhere**

By default, the script looks for resource packs in the same folder it is placed in. You can change where the script looks by editing the variables inside the python script, in your favorite text editor

**5. Run the script**

Open the shuffler.py file with Python.

If you shuffle resource packs with multiple pack formats, the created pack has a small chance to cause unexpected in-game results, or not work. There isn't an easy solution to fix this. Try to use resource packs with the same pack format.

For more information on pack formats, read through the History section here: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack#History

If all of the source packs are compatible with the Minecraft version you are using, then the shuffled pack should be compatible no matter what Minecraft tells you.

If Minecraft is telling you the packs are incompatable, but you know the source packs should be compatable, you can change the shuffler's intPackFormat variable. Read the link above for more information on what number to use. This only tells Minecraft what format the shuffled pack should be in, and does not have any effect on the compatibility of the shuffled pack's contents.

**6. Use the shuffled pack**

To open your resource packs folder, open Minecraft. Navigate to Options > Resource Packs > Open Resource Pack Folder. Finally, move the shuffled pack into Minecraft's resource pack folder.

If you put multiple shuffled packs into Minecraft's resource pack folder, the most recently created shuffled pack will be closest to the bottom of the selection menu.

# Important notes

You should not distribute the shuffled packs, and you cannot claim you made them. This is because the creators of the source resource packs own the original textures used to create the shuffled packs.

That does not apply if you have created *all* of the source resource packs.
